\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The results of this paper show that using NLP techniques to cluster test cases based on textual similarity offers notable improvements in bug detection efficiency compared to simpler test selection methods. Selecting even 30\% of tests using our approach revealed a substantially improved bug detection rate compared to just selecting random tests. 

As human resources might become a problem for rapidly growing projects that also have a growing number of manual tests to be performed, especially in the open-source world, our method can achieve a favorable tradeoff between time spent testing and bugs covered.

Furthermore,  our work supports the findings of Viggiato et al. \cite{Viggiato}, indicating that textual similarity of test steps provides a useful indicator of overall test case similarity, at least within our dataset.
