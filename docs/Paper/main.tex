\begin{abstract}
Even though there have been many advancements in recent years, a significant portion of software testing still needs to be conducted manually. This means that, with each software release requiring numerous manual tests, a considerable amount of time is spent executing these tests. Meanwhile, many of these tests tend to overlap regarding bug detection, which could be avoided if a method were found to execute only the necessary number of tests, as multiple tests may detect the same bug. One solution using this fact is to cluster tests based on the language used in their descriptions, in this case only their test steps. Then, by selecting only a subset of all tests based on that clustering, we get tests that are dissimilar in their language. This results in a significantly larger bug coverage. When selecting 50\% of tests with this approach, we cover 72.5\% of bug tickets, compared to 53\% with a more naive approach. These results are promising, especially considering only so little information was used to find test similarity.
