\begin{abstract}
Even though there have been many advancements in recent years, a significant amount of testing still needs to be conducted manually. This means that with each software release requiring numerous manual tests, a considerable amount of time is spent executing these tests. Meanwhile, many of these tests tend to overlap in bug detection, which could be avoided if a method were found to execute only the necessary number of tests, as multiple tests may detect the same bug. One way to achieve this is by clustering them through an analysis of the language used in their description. Then, by carefully selecting only a subset of all tests based on said clustering, a lot of time can be saved, especially if the selected tests cover a significant portion of the detected bugs.
